## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE - Gate check PASSED (5/5 criteria) with template compliance!
2. ✅ Phase 2 (Requirements) COMPLETE - All 5 deliverables verified by VER agent
3. ✅ APPROVAL CHAIN COMPLETE (20 entries)
4. ✅ **PHASE 2 GATE CHECK PASSED** (15/15 criteria) - 2026-02-19
5. **CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT**: CM to create Baseline 1 (Requirements)
   - Tag repository: `baseline-1-requirements`
   - Commit all Phase 2 deliverables
   - Update configuration records
6. **BEGIN PHASE 3**: Architecture & Design
   - Primary agent: `/des` (Designer)
   - Supporting: `/saf` (Safety), `/qua` (Quality - template check), `/ver` (Verifier)
   - **NEW WORKFLOW**: DES → SAF → QUA (template check) → VER

### Phase 2 Final Status
- [x] Establish SRS (REQ) - ✅ VERIFIED - ✅ APPROVED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Establish RTM (REQ) - ✅ VERIFIED - ✅ APPROVED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Establish Hazard Log (SAF) - ✅ VERIFIED - ✅ APPROVED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Establish Overall Software Test Specification (TST) - ✅ VERIFIED - ✅ APPROVED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Establish Software Requirements Verification Report (VER) - ✅ APPROVED - ✅ GATE PASSED

### Phase 3 (Architecture & Design) - READY TO BEGIN
**Command**: `/des` - Start architecture and design
**Deliverables** (8 documents per EN 50128 Annex C):
- [ ] Software Architecture Specification (SAS) - DOC-SAS-2026-001
- [ ] Software Design Specification (SDS) - DOC-SDS-2026-001
- [ ] Software Interface Specifications - DOC-INTERFACES-2026-001
- [ ] Software Integration Test Specification - DOC-INTTEST-2026-001
- [ ] Software/Hardware Integration Test Specification - DOC-HWINTTEST-2026-001
- [ ] Software Component Design Specification - DOC-COMPDES-2026-001
- [ ] Software Component Test Specification - DOC-COMPTEST-2026-001
- [ ] Software Architecture and Design Verification Report - DOC-DESVER-2026-001

**Key Design Constraints** (from SRS):
- Modular architecture (MANDATORY SIL 2+)
- Static memory allocation only (no malloc/free)
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10 per function
- No recursion
- Defensive programming patterns
- Fixed-width integer types

### Ready for Gate Check?
**Phase 2 Status**: ✅ **GATE PASSED** (2026-02-19)  
**Gate Check Report**: docs/reports/Phase2-Gate-Check.md  
**Result**: 15/15 criteria met, 0 defects, 100% traceability  
**Authorization**: ✅ **APPROVED TO PROCEED TO PHASE 3**  
**Next Phase**: Phase 3 (Architecture & Design)

## Notes

✅ **Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE WITH TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE** (2026-02-18)

**Original Approval Chain (Initial):**
- ✅ All 5 deliverables approved (SQAP v1.0, SQAP-Verification, SCMP v1.0, SVP v1.0, SVaP v1.0)
- ✅ Complete PM→VER→VAL→COD approval chain executed (20 approval chain entries)
- ✅ Gate check PASSED with 5/5 criteria met
- ✅ Baseline 0 established (2026-02-18)

⚠️ **Template Compliance Issue Identified & RESOLVED** (2026-02-18)

**Problem:** Planning documents (SQAP, SCMP, SVP, SVaP) missing mandatory template structure:
- Missing Document ID field (DOC-TYPE-YYYY-NNN format)
- Missing Document Control table (version history)
- Missing Approvals table (SIL 3 signature requirements)

**Root Cause:** Templates embedded in SKILL.md rather than separate files

**Resolution:**
1. ✅ Created comprehensive template system (.opencode/skills/en50128-documentation/templates/)
2. ✅ Regenerated 4 documents (SQAP v2.0, SCMP v2.0, SVP v2.0, SVaP v2.0) with proper structure
3. ✅ Updated QUA and VER commands to enforce template compliance
4. ✅ Re-executed full approval chain (PM→VER→VAL→COD) for 4 regenerated documents
5. ✅ VER verified template compliance for all documents (Document ID ✓, Document Control ✓, Approvals ✓)

**Re-Approval Results:**
- ✅ SQAP v2.0 (DOC-SQAP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SCMP v2.0 (DOC-SCMP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SVP v2.0 (DOC-SVP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SVaP v2.0 (DOC-SVAP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SQAP-Verification: No changes needed - APPROVED

**Approval Chain Statistics:**
- Total approval chain entries: 40 (20 initial + 4 regeneration + 16 re-approval)
- Template compliance verifications: 4 (all passed)
- Documents regenerated: 4
- Gate checks passed: 2 (initial + re-approval)

**Key Achievements:**
1. ✅ All planning documents now EN 50128 template compliant (SIL 3 mandatory requirement)
2. ✅ Template compliance enforcement added to QUA and VER agents
3. ✅ Complete audit trail of template compliance fix (40 approval chain entries)
4. ✅ Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE with all deliverables properly structured

Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Requirements.
USER APPROVAL REQUIRED for all requirement establishment/modification activities.
Assessment phase (Phase 7) will be required for SIL 3.
