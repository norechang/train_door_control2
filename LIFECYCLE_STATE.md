2. ✅ Phase 2 (Requirements) COMPLETE - All 5 deliverables verified by VER agent
3. ✅ **PHASE 2 GATE CHECK PASSED** (15/15 criteria) - 2026-02-19
4. ✅ Phase 3 (Architecture & Design) COMPLETE - All 6 deliverables VER/VAL approved
5. ✅ **PHASE 3 GATE CHECK PASSED** (12/12 criteria) - 2026-02-21
6. ✅ Phase 4 (Component Design) COMPLETE - All 6 deliverables VER/VAL approved
7. ✅ **PHASE 4 GATE CHECK PASSED** (12/12 criteria) - 2026-02-22
8. **CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT**: CM to create Baseline 3 (Component Design)
   - Tag repository: `baseline-3-component-design`
   - Commit all Phase 4 deliverables
   - Update configuration records
9. **BEGIN PHASE 5**: Component Implementation and Testing
   - Primary agent: `/imp` (Implementer)
   - Supporting: `/tst` (Tester), `/qua` (Quality), `/ver` (Verifier)
   - **WORKFLOW**: IMP (C code) → TST (unit tests) → QUA (code review) → VER (verification)

### Phase 4 Final Status
- [x] Software Component Design Specification (DES) - ✅ QUA APPROVED - ✅ VER VERIFIED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Software Component Test Specification (TST) - ✅ QUA APPROVED - ✅ VER VERIFIED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Software Component Design Verification Report (VER) - ✅ QUA APPROVED - ✅ VAL VALIDATED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Software Component Design Validation Report (VAL) - ✅ QUA APPROVED - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] QA Template Reviews (QUA) - ✅ 2 reports approved - ✅ GATE PASSED
- [x] Phase 4 Gate Check (COD) - ✅ 12/12 criteria met - ✅ 0 technical defects - ✅ AUTHORIZED TO PROCEED

### Phase 5 (Component Implementation and Testing) - READY TO BEGIN
**Command**: `/pm execute-phase component-implementation-testing --auto-qua` (automated workflow)  
**Alternative**: `/imp` - Start C code implementation manually

**Deliverables** (per EN 50128 Section 7.5 and Annex C):
- [ ] Source Code Implementation (C files with MISRA C:2012 compliance)
- [ ] Unit Test Implementation (Unity framework)
- [ ] Unit Test Execution Report (coverage 100% for SIL 3)
- [ ] Component Implementation Verification Report (VER)
- [ ] Component Implementation Validation Report (VAL)

**Key Implementation Constraints** (from Component Design):
- MISRA C:2012 compliance (MANDATORY SIL 2+)
- Static memory allocation only (no malloc/free)
- Cyclomatic complexity ≤ 10 per function (already verified in design)
- No recursion
- 100% defensive programming (NULL checks, range validation)
- Fixed-width integer types (uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t)
- 100% statement/branch/condition coverage (MANDATORY SIL 3)

### Ready for Gate Check?
**Phase 4 Status**: ✅ **GATE PASSED** (2026-02-22)  
**Gate Check Report**: docs/reports/Phase4-Gate-Check.md  
**Result**: 12/12 criteria met, 0 technical defects, 2 minor template defects (non-blocking)  
**Authorization**: ✅ **APPROVED TO PROCEED TO PHASE 5**  
**Next Phase**: Phase 5 (Component Implementation and Testing)

## Notes

✅ **Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE WITH TEMPLATE COMPLIANCE** (2026-02-18)

**Original Approval Chain (Initial):**
- ✅ All 5 deliverables approved (SQAP v1.0, SQAP-Verification, SCMP v1.0, SVP v1.0, SVaP v1.0)
- ✅ Complete PM→VER→VAL→COD approval chain executed (20 approval chain entries)
- ✅ Gate check PASSED with 5/5 criteria met
- ✅ Baseline 0 established (2026-02-18)

⚠️ **Template Compliance Issue Identified & RESOLVED** (2026-02-18)

**Problem:** Planning documents (SQAP, SCMP, SVP, SVaP) missing mandatory template structure:
- Missing Document ID field (DOC-TYPE-YYYY-NNN format)
- Missing Document Control table (version history)
- Missing Approvals table (SIL 3 signature requirements)

**Root Cause:** Templates embedded in SKILL.md rather than separate files

**Resolution:**
1. ✅ Created comprehensive template system (.opencode/skills/en50128-documentation/templates/)
2. ✅ Regenerated 4 documents (SQAP v2.0, SCMP v2.0, SVP v2.0, SVaP v2.0) with proper structure
3. ✅ Updated QUA and VER commands to enforce template compliance
4. ✅ Re-executed full approval chain (PM→VER→VAL→COD) for 4 regenerated documents
5. ✅ VER verified template compliance for all documents (Document ID ✓, Document Control ✓, Approvals ✓)

**Re-Approval Results:**
- ✅ SQAP v2.0 (DOC-SQAP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SCMP v2.0 (DOC-SCMP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SVP v2.0 (DOC-SVP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SVaP v2.0 (DOC-SVAP-2026-001): Template compliant - APPROVED
- ✅ SQAP-Verification: No changes needed - APPROVED

**Approval Chain Statistics:**
- Total approval chain entries: 40 (20 initial + 4 regeneration + 16 re-approval)
- Template compliance verifications: 4 (all passed)
- Documents regenerated: 4
- Gate checks passed: 2 (initial + re-approval)

**Key Achievements:**
1. ✅ All planning documents now EN 50128 template compliant (SIL 3 mandatory requirement)
2. ✅ Template compliance enforcement added to QUA and VER agents
3. ✅ Complete audit trail of template compliance fix (40 approval chain entries)
4. ✅ Phase 1 (Planning) COMPLETE with all deliverables properly structured

Ready to proceed to Phase 2: Requirements.
USER APPROVAL REQUIRED for all requirement establishment/modification activities.
Assessment phase (Phase 7) will be required for SIL 3.
