## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Purpose

This System Safety Requirements Specification (SSRS) defines the safety requirements, hazards, risk analysis, and safety integrity requirements for the **Train Door Control System**. It establishes the safety baseline for allocating safety requirements to hardware and software subsystems.

This document serves as the **primary safety input** to:
- Software Requirements Specification (EN 50128 Section 7.2) - for software safety requirements
- Hardware Requirements Specification - for hardware safety requirements
- System Safety Plan - for safety assurance activities

### 1.2 Scope

This SSRS applies to the Train Door Control System for passenger railway vehicles, covering:
- System-level hazard identification and analysis
- Risk assessment and SIL determination
- System safety requirements
- Safety integrity requirements
- Allocation of safety functions to subsystems
- Safety-related interfaces

**Safety Standards Applied**:
- EN 50126-2:2017 (RAMS - Systems approach to safety)
- EN 50129:2018 (Safety related electronic systems for signalling)
- EN 50128:2011 (Software for railway control and protection systems)

### 1.3 System SIL Classification

**System SIL Level**: **SIL 3**

This classification is derived from hazard analysis per EN 50126-2 risk assessment methodology.

---

## 2. HAZARD ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Hazard Identification

Per EN 50126-2, hazards are identified through systematic analysis of system operation, failures, and environmental conditions.

#### Hazard Log Summary

| Hazard ID | Hazard Description | Potential Cause | Consequence | Severity | Frequency | Risk Class | Initial SIL |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|-------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **SYS-HAZ-001** | Doors open while train is moving (>5 km/h) | Speed interlock failure, software error, sensor failure | Passenger fall from train → Multiple fatalities | Catastrophic | Credible | Unacceptable | **SIL 3** |
| **SYS-HAZ-002** | Doors close on passenger causing injury | Obstacle detection failure, excessive closing force | Passenger trapped/crushed → Serious injury | Critical | Probable | Undesirable | **SIL 2** |
| **SYS-HAZ-003** | Doors fail to open during emergency evacuation | Door control failure, lock failure, power loss | Passenger entrapment in emergency → Fatalities | Catastrophic | Occasional | Unacceptable | **SIL 3** |
| **SYS-HAZ-004** | Door unlocks while train is moving | Lock control failure, software error | Passenger could manually open door → Fatality | Catastrophic | Remote | Undesirable | **SIL 3** |
| **SYS-HAZ-005** | Incorrect platform side door opening | Platform detection failure, software error | Passenger exits on non-platform side → Fatality | Catastrophic | Remote | Undesirable | **SIL 2** |
| **SYS-HAZ-006** | Door fails to close and lock before departure | Control failure, mechanical failure | Train departs with open door → Passenger fall | Catastrophic | Occasional | Unacceptable | **SIL 3** |
| **SYS-HAZ-007** | Unintended door opening at station | Spurious command, software error | Passenger egress on wrong side → Injury | Marginal | Probable | Tolerable | **SIL 1** |
| **SYS-HAZ-008** | Loss of door status indication to driver | Display failure, communication failure | Driver unaware of door state → Incorrect actions | Critical | Probable | Undesirable | **SIL 1** |
| **SYS-HAZ-009** | Emergency release inoperative | Mechanical failure, design error | Passenger cannot escape in emergency → Fatalities | Catastrophic | Remote | Undesirable | **SIL 3** |

**Risk Matrix** (per EN 50126-2):

| Severity ↓ / Frequency → | Frequent | Probable | Occasional | Remote | Improbable | Incredible |
|---------------------------|----------|----------|------------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Catastrophic** | Intolerable | Unacceptable | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Tolerable | Acceptable |
| **Critical** | Unacceptable | Undesirable | Undesirable | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable |
| **Marginal** | Undesirable | Tolerable | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable |
| **Negligible** | Tolerable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable | Acceptable |

### 2.2 SIL Determination

Per EN 50129 Table A.1, SIL levels are determined based on risk classification:

| Risk Class | Action Required | Typical SIL |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Intolerable** | Must be eliminated or reduced | SIL 4 |
| **Unacceptable** | Shall only be accepted with adequate risk reduction | SIL 3-4 |
| **Undesirable** | Shall only be tolerated if risk reduction is impractical | SIL 2-3 |
| **Tolerable** | Accepted with review by railway authority | SIL 1-2 |
| **Acceptable** | Acceptable without additional safety requirements | SIL 0-1 |

**System SIL Assignment**:
- **HAZ-001, HAZ-003, HAZ-004, HAZ-006, HAZ-009**: Unacceptable risk → **SIL 3**
- **HAZ-002, HAZ-005**: Undesirable risk → **SIL 2**
- **HAZ-007, HAZ-008**: Tolerable risk → **SIL 1**

**Overall System SIL**: **SIL 3** (highest hazard-driven SIL)

### 2.3 Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)

FMEA performed per EN 50126-2 Annex C. Key failure modes analyzed:

| Component | Failure Mode | Effect | Severity | Detection Method | Mitigation | SIL |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|------------------|------------|-----|
| Speed Sensor | Erroneous speed reading (low) | System permits door opening while moving | Catastrophic | Redundant sensors (2oo2), plausibility checks | Diverse speed sources, watchdog | **SIL 3** |
| Position Sensor | False "door closed" signal | System locks door while not fully closed | Critical | Redundant sensors (2oo2) | Dual sensors with cross-check | **SIL 3** |
| Obstacle Sensor | Failure to detect obstacle | Doors close on passenger | Critical | Sensor self-test, redundant sensors | Dual IR beams, force limit | **SIL 2** |
| Door Lock | Lock fails to engage | Door unlocks while moving | Catastrophic | Lock position sensors (2oo2) | Redundant locks, continuous monitoring | **SIL 3** |

| Emergency Release | Mechanism jammed | Passengers trapped in emergency | Catastrophic | Regular inspection, pull-test | Mechanical redundancy, fail-safe design | **SIL 3** |
| Communication Bus | Loss of speed data | Speed interlock non-functional | Catastrophic | CRC, timeout detection | Fail-safe default (doors locked), redundant channels | **SIL 3** |

### 2.4 Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)

Top Event: **Passenger falls from train due to door opening while moving** (HAZ-001)

```

```

**Quantitative FTA Results**:
- Target dangerous failure rate (top event): λ ≤ 10^-9 per hour (SIL 3)
- Speed sensor failure (2oo2): λ = 10^-6 per hour each → λ_combined = 10^-12 per hour
- Software systematic failure: SC 2 (Systematic Capability per EN 50129) → adequate for SIL 3
- Lock mechanism (2oo2): λ = 10^-6 per hour each → λ_combined = 10^-12 per hour
- **Total system dangerous failure rate**: λ_system ≈ 5 × 10^-9 per hour → **Meets SIL 3** (< 10^-8)

### 3.1 Safety Functions

The following safety functions are identified:

### 3.2 Safety Integrity Requirements

#### 3.2.1 Hardware Safety Integrity

**SAFE-HW-001**: Hardware SHALL achieve SIL 3 hardware fault tolerance per EN 50129 Table A.2.  
**Requirement**: For SIL 3, either:
- Hardware Fault Tolerance = 1 (single fault does not cause hazard), OR
- Safe Failure Fraction ≥ 99%

**Applied**: Redundant sensors (2oo2) for critical functions → HFT = 1

**SAFE-HW-002**: Position sensors for "door closed" SHALL be implemented with 2oo2 architecture (2 out of 2 must agree).  
**Rationale**: SF-006 (SIL 3)

**SAFE-HW-003**: Lock position sensors SHALL be implemented with 2oo2 architecture.  
**Rationale**: SF-002 (SIL 3)

**SAFE-HW-004**: Speed input SHALL use redundant sources (2oo2) or diverse sensors.  
**Rationale**: SF-001 (SIL 3)

**SAFE-HW-005**: Emergency release mechanism SHALL be mechanical (independent of electronics).  
**Rationale**: SF-004 (SIL 3), fail-safe independence

**SAFE-HW-006**: Door closing force SHALL be mechanically limited to ≤ 150 N (EN 14752).  
**Rationale**: SF-003 (SIL 2), passive safety

#### 3.2.2 Software Safety Integrity

**SAFE-SW-001**: Software controlling SF-001, SF-002, SF-006, SF-007 SHALL be developed to SIL 3 per EN 50128.  
**Requirement**: EN 50128 Table A.3, A.4, A.5 mandatory and highly recommended techniques for SIL 3-4.

**SAFE-SW-002**: Software SHALL achieve Systematic Capability SC 2 per EN 50129 Table A.3 (adequate for SIL 3).

**SAFE-SW-003**: Software SHALL implement defensive programming per EN 50128 Table A.3 (Highly Recommended for SIL 3).

**SAFE-SW-004**: Software SHALL use structured programming (mandatory for SIL 3-4).

**SAFE-SW-005**: Software cyclomatic complexity SHALL NOT exceed 10 (EN 50128 recommendation for SIL 3-4).

**SAFE-SW-006**: Software SHALL achieve 100% statement, branch, and MC/DC coverage for SIL 3 functions (EN 50128 Table A.21).

**SAFE-SW-007**: Software SHALL NOT use dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free forbidden for SIL 2+).

**SAFE-SW-008**: Software SHALL comply with MISRA C:2012 (mandatory for SIL 2+).

**SAFE-SW-009**: Software SHALL implement watchdog monitoring (timeout ≤ 100 ms).

**SAFE-SW-010**: Software SHALL use CRC protection for all safety-critical data structures and communications.

### 3.3 Common Cause Failures

**SAFE-CCF-001**: The system SHALL implement protection against common cause failures for redundant channels:
- Diverse sensor technologies where feasible
- Physical separation of redundant sensors
- Independent processing channels (if applicable)
- Diverse software (if dual processing used)

**Rationale**: EN 50129 Annex B - Common cause failures can defeat redundancy

**SAFE-CCF-002**: Software SHALL use diverse programming for critical safety functions (if resources permit):
- Two independent implementations of speed interlock logic
- Cross-comparison and voting

**Applicability**: Recommended for SIL 3-4 per EN 50128 Table A.4

### 3.4 Fault Detection and Diagnostics

**SAFE-DIAG-001**: The system SHALL detect ≥ 99% of dangerous failures (diagnostic coverage DC ≥ 99% for SIL 3).

**SAFE-DIAG-002**: The system SHALL detect sensor faults within 100 ms.

**SAFE-DIAG-003**: The system SHALL detect communication faults within 200 ms (2x communication cycle).

**SAFE-DIAG-004**: The system SHALL implement online self-test for all safety-critical sensors and actuators.

**SAFE-DIAG-005**: The system SHALL log all detected faults with timestamp for analysis.

### 3.5 Safe States

**SAFE-STATE-001**: Upon detection of critical fault affecting SF-001 or SF-002 (door interlocks), the system SHALL:
- Immediately lock all doors (if train moving or fault prevents safe determination of speed)
- Prevent door opening until fault cleared
- Alert driver

**SAFE-STATE-002**: Upon loss of speed information, the system SHALL assume "train moving" (conservative assumption) and lock doors.

**SAFE-STATE-003**: Upon detection of position sensor fault, the system SHALL assume "door not closed" until fault cleared.

**SAFE-STATE-004**: Safe states SHALL be maintained even under power loss (mechanical locks fail-closed, emergency release remains mechanical).

### 3.6 Safety-Related Application Conditions

**SAFE-COND-001**: Emergency Evacuation Mode (which bypasses speed interlock) SHALL only be activated when:
- Explicit authorization from driver OR emergency controller
- Train speed < 5 km/h (verified by independent speed sensor)
- Emergency situation confirmed

**Rationale**: Prevents misuse of safety interlock bypass

**SAFE-COND-002**: Maintenance Mode (manual door operation) SHALL NOT bypass safety interlocks (speed interlock remains active).

**SAFE-COND-003**: Diagnostic Mode SHALL only be permitted when train is stationary and secured (parking brake applied).
